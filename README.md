# Milestone-1-Webgame

## Deployment

The web game is deployed at <https://antwantx.github.io/Milestone-1-Webgame/>.


## Project Description

_(A game of snake where growing your body is key without hitting edges or running into yourself.)_


## Game Logic

As the player, you will use the arrow keys on the keyboard to control the direction of the snake as you try to eat the food as it pops up. As you continue to eat the food, the snake will grow in size and move faster. The goal is to eat 10 pieces of food before the timer runs out. If the snake runs into itself or hits any of the 4 borders, then the game will end. You can click the "Let's Play" at anytime to resart the game. 

### MVP Criteria

1. Have the game start with the click of the arrows
2. The snake needs to move with whichever arrow is clicked
3. Have the snake grow with every block of food eaten
4. Have the snake move faster as the game progresses
4. The timer must start as the game starts and end the game if it reaches 0:00
5. A prompt stating if the player has won or lost depending on the outcome.
6. The "Let's Play" link must return the game to the very beginning
